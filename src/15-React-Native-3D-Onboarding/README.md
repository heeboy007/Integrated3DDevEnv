# React Native 3D Onboarding Screen Using Reanimated and React Three Fiber

Create 3d Onboarding Screen in React Native using [Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs) and [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)

If you use the iOS simulator, the 3D assets will not be rendered, so use a physical iOS device or Android emulator
